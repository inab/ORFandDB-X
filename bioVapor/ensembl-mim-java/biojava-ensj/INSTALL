This document details how to install the ensj.jar library. 



1 - Download ensj.jar or ensj.tgz/ensj.zip from 

  http://www.ensembl.org/java

If you downloaded ensj.tgz or ensj.zip file uncompress it and then
locate the ensj.jar file.


2 - Install ensj.jar plus it's supporting jars; either add them to
your classpath or put them in your .../jre/lib/ext directory.

The ensj.jar needs the following jars

   mysql-connector-XXXXX-jar   			- MySQL JDBC driver


You might also need to install these

   junit.jar                                   - Test framework, only needed if you 
                                                 intend to run the regression tests.
   java-getopt-1.0.9.jar                       	- Command line utility class.


Best place to pick these up is web site above. Searching google will
also probably work.



3 - Test the installation by running the Example program. This
makes test connections to the public MySQL daemon running on a
computer at the Sanger Center

    java org.ensembl.Example

It will print some data that was read from the database. If this does
not happen then your setup is incorrect. By examining the error
messages it should be possible to determine the fault. 

	-"Class not found" means that the jars are not properly installed. 

	-Database connection problems might indicate a firewall
	problem, can you connect to ensembldb.ensembl.org using a normal mysql
	client? On un*x try

           mysql -h ensembldb.ensembl.org -u anonymous


4 - Once the library is installed you can use the classes and
interfaces as normal in your programs.
