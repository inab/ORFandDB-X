Data types that appear in the core ensembl databases such as
Genes, Exons and Karyotypes and various support classes such as
Location.

<p>
Most of the types are defined as interfaces in this package with
implementing classes in org.ensembl.datamodel.impl.
</p>

<p>
Biological objects such as Exons are Locatable because they have
locations on sequences. 
</p>

<p>
Ensj supports one type of Location which can specify part or all of a
region in a coordinate system. This replaces the AssemblyLocation and
CloneFragmentLocation classes which are deprecated.
