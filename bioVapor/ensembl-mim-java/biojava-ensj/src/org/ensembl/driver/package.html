Driver and adaptors for accessing ensembl core databases.


<p>
The Driver and adaptors specify interfaces which can be implemented to
provide access to specific datasources. 
</p>

<p>
Implementations for other datasources such as flat files or an Oracle
database could also be added by implementing relevant adaptors and,
where necessary, a driver. This provides an extensible means for
seamlessly loading 3rd party data into native Ensembl datatypes as
well as supporting instances of ensembl data in non-mysql databases.
