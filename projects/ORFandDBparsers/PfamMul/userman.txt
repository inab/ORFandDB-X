  This document currently includes a more detailed description of the
  fields used in the Pfam database.  The format of Pfam entries has
  become stricter and we now enforce some ordering of the fields.
  Pfam entries are composed of four sections shown in the figure
  below.

  Header Section:
  ---------------

  The header section mainly contains compulsory fields.  These include
  Pfam specific information such as accession numbers and identifiers,
  as well as a short description of the family.  The only
  non-compulsory field in the header section is the PI field.  All the
  fields in this section are described below.

  AC   Accession number:          PFxxxxx or PBxxxxxx

       The Pfam-A accession numbers PFxxxxx are the stable identifier
       for each Pfam families.  The Pfam-B accession PBxxxxxx numbers
       are not stable between releases of Pfam.

       PFxxxxx for Pfam entries
       PBxxxxxx for Pfam-B entries

  ID   Identification:            15 characters or less

       This field is designed to be a meaningful identifier for the
       family.

       Capitalisation of the first letter will be
       preferred. Underscores are used in place of space, and hyphens
       are only used to mean hyphens.

  DE   Definition:                80 characters or less

       This must be a one line description of the Pfam family.

  AU   Author:

       Author of the entry.

       The format for this record is shown below, this is a comma
       separated list on a single line.

       AU   Bloggs JJ, Bloggs JE

  AL   Alignment method of seed:  

       The method used to align the seed members.

       This field has a restricted vocabulary. Currently the approved
       AL lines are shown below.  It is important to note that this
       field only gives a guide to the method used for alignment
       construction.  You may find for example that Clustalw does not
       give an identical alignment to that found in Pfam even if the
       AL line shows Clustalw as the method.

       AL   Clustalv
       AL   Clustalw
       AL   Clustalw_mask_xxxx
       AL   Clustalw_manual
       AL   Domainer
       AL   HMM_built_from_alignment
       AL   HMM_simulated_annealing
       AL   Manual
       AL   Prosite_pattern
       AL   Prodom
       AL   Structure_superposition
       AL   Domainer
       AL   pftools
       AL   Unknown
       AL   T_Coffee
       AL   MAFFT
       AL   Alignment kindly provided by SMART
       AL   converted_from_SMART

       Any method can have _manual appended to it, to indicate minor
       changes.  e.g AL Clustalw_manual

       Manual alignments are those from any method which have been
       altered by hand.

  BM   HMM building command lines.  

       See the HMMER 2 user's manual for full instructions on building
       HMMs. Also see URL:

       http://hmmer.wustl.edu/

       An example of the BM lines from a single entry

       BM   hmmbuild -F HMM_ls SEED
       BM   hmmcalibrate --seed 0 HMM_ls

       All models are calibrated using a seed of zero to allow exact
       replication of HMM construction.

  SE   Source of seed:    

       The source suggesting seed members belong to a family.

  GA   Gathering threshold:   

       Search threshold to build the full alignment.

       GA lines are the thresholds in bits used in the hmmsearch
       command line.  An example GA line is shown below:

       GA   25.00 15.00; 12.00 5.00

       The order of the thresholds is ls mode sequence, ls mode domain,
       fs mode sequence, fs mode domain.

       The corresponding hmmsearch command line for the ls mode HMM
       would be:

       hmmsearch -T 25 --domT 15 HMM DB

       The -T option specifies the whole sequence score in bits, and
       the --domT option specifies the per-domain threshold in bits.

  NC   Noise cutoff:

       This field refers to the bit scores of the highest scoring
       match not in the full alignment.

       An example NC line is shown below

       NC   19.50 18.10; 11.10 4.60

       As with the GA line, this field contains two sets of two
       numbers - the first set refer to the ls mode HMM and the second
       set to the fs mode HMM. The first number in each set refers to
       the highest whole sequence score in bits of a match not in the
       full alignment, and the second number specifies the highest
       per-domain score in bits of a match not in the full alignment.
       These two scores may not refer to the same sequence.

  TC   Trusted cutoff:

       This field refers to the bit scores of the lowest scoring match
       in the full alignment.

       An example TC line is shown below

       TC   23.00 16.10; 17.30 6.10

       As with the GA line, this field contains two sets of two
       numbers - the first set refer to the ls mode HMM and the second
       set to the fs mode HMM.  The first number in each set refers to
       the lowest whole sequence score in bits of a match in the full
       alignment, and the second number specifies the lowest
       per-domain score in bits of a match in the full alignment.
       These two scores may not refer to the same sequence.

  TP   Type field:                 Single word

       The type field is a compulsory field describing the type of
       family.  At present it can be one of:

       TP   Family
       TP   Domain
       TP   Repeat
       TP   Motif

  PI   Previous IDs:               Semi-colon list

      The most recent names are stored on the left.  This field is
      non-compulsory.


  Reference Section:

  The reference section mainly contains cross-links to other
  databases, and literature references.  All the fields in this
  section are described below.


  DC   Database Comment:           Comment for database reference.

  Alignment Section:
  ------------------

  AM   buildmethod             Indicates the order that ls and fs matches are
			       aligned to the model to give the full alignment.
			       
			       globalfirst - ls matches are aligned first followed 
					     by fs matches that do not overlap.

			       byscore     - matches are aligned in order of 
					     evalue score - best first.
				
                               localfirst  - fs matches are aligned first followed 
					     by ls matches that do not overlap.

  NE   Pfam accession;         Pfam family <accession> may be nested within this
			       family.  Family <accession> aand this family are
			       allowed to overlap.
  
  NL   Sequence/start-stop;    Indicates the location of the nested domain
			       within the full alignment.  Tied to a sequence

  SQ   Sequence:               Number of sequences, start of alignment.

  //                           End of alignment


  The alignment is in Stockholm format.  This includes mark-ups of four
  types:

     #=GF <featurename> <Generic per-File annotation, free text>
     #=GC <featurename> <Generic per-Column annotation, exactly 1 char per column>
     #=GS <seqname> <featurename> <Generic per-Sequence annotation, free text>
     #=GR <seqname> <featurename> <Generic per-Sequence AND per-Column mark up, exactly 1 char per column>

  Recommended placements:

     #=GF Above the alignment
     #=GC Below the alignment
     #=GS Above the alignment or just below the corresponding sequence
     #=GR Just below the corresponding sequence

  The alignment formats have the following size limits:

     <aligned sequence>: max 4096 characters.
     <seqname>: max 50 characters.
     <featurename> max 50 characters.

  These details can also be found on the web, see URL:

     http://www.cgr.ki.se/cgr/groups/sonnhammer/Stockholm.html

  Structural mark ups are now provided by Pfam.  For each sequence of
  known structure we provide #=GR lines with feuturenames SS and SA
  for secondary structure and surface accessibility respectively. For
  the whole family we provide consensus #=GC lines with feature names
  SS_cons and SA_cons.

  Pfam marks up active site residues in the multiple sequence
  alignments.  Active site residues are derived from the Swiss-Prot
  feature table.  Active sites which are not annotated in the Swiss-Prot
  feature table as being probable, potential or by similarity are
  given the feature name AS.  

  Pfam predicts a residue to be an active site residue if it aligns
  in a Pfam alignment with a Swiss-Prot annotated active site, and is of
  the same amino acid type.  Active sites which are predicted by Pfam
  are given the feature name pAS.

  Active site residues which are annotated in Swiss-Prot as being
  probable, potential or by similarity are marked as predicted active
  sites, as long as they do no overlap with a Pfam predicted active site.
  Active sites which are annotated as probable, potential or by
  similarity by Swiss-Prot are given the feature name sAS.

  In all cases, active sites are marked with an asterix.  Below is an example: 


     #=GR SERA_ECOLI/12-325 AS      ...........*..............
     #=GR SERA_ECO57/12-325 pAS     ...........*..............
     #=GR YN14_YEAST/124-327 sAS    ........*.................


  The consensus sequence for both the SEED and full alignment are provided by
  Pfam, denoted by #=GC seq_cons at the beginning of the line.  In all cases 
  a threshold of 60% is used (i.e 60% or above, of the amino acids in this
  column belong to this class of residue). Below is the key to the alignment 
  mark up.  The program used was orginally from the Consensus program by Nigel
  Brown of the EMBL.
