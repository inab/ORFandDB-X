README.txt for ans2all
======================

asn2all is a tool from ncbi_tools package. This tool is able to create
formatted files from GenBank and RefSeq databases in ASN.1 format. One of the
supported formats is XML. This tool is NOT able to create a XML file from
ENZYME in ASN.1 format.

So, this directory will only contain a thin wrapper description around this tool.
